        Hi, I am Sonia T. Sanchez, welcome to my personal site.
        <br></br>
        I attended workshops and meetups in the London area and was
        excited by the power of modern JavaScript.
        <br></br>
        Currently studying the last year of Software Development and networking
        degree, I am searching for a junior role within an agile team.
        <br></br>
        I enjoy pairing with other developers and the satisfaction of
        solving a problem together on a team application. Recently, I attended a
        Silicon Roundabout and Kodiri event in which we completed coding
        challenges and I score a maximum of 91 points .

  );
}

export default WhoAmI;
